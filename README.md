Visit the app [here](https://bmai53.github.io/reddit-search/)!

This app allows the user to search for Reddit posts and comments using [pushshift](https://pushshift.io/) API. 

#### Users can search by:
- Author
- Subreddit
- Title of Post

#### To Do:
- add dark mode
- add header/footer
- add additional filtering + rework form layout
- look into alternative date picker, material ui native date picker is buggy
